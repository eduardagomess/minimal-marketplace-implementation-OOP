We should develop an application that when initialized it shows to the user a menu containing the options: register, list, buy products,visualize the shopping bag and exit application.

When adding a product to the shopping bag, it should be checked if the same product already exists in the bag, just by changing the quantity. At the end of the purchase, the total must be presented to the user according to the products and quantities in his shopping bag.
